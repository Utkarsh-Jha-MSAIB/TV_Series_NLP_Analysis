**Character Analysis Across Iconic TV Series**

This project explores character dynamics, dialogue sentiment, and text-based similarity across four major TV series:
**Friends, Game of Thrones, The Office,** and **The Big Bang Theory**
Using natural language processing (NLP), we analyze patterns in scripts to uncover:
--Character similarities across shows
--Sentiment trends and emotional arcs
--Dialogue volume and use of language
--Script-based obscenity and tone
The goal is to identify whether perceived similarities between characters are supported by data, and how sentiment might correlate with broader show perception, including IMDB ratings.
