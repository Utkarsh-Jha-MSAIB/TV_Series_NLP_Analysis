# Character Analysis Across Iconic TV Series
---

This project explores character dynamics, dialogue sentiment, and text-based similarity across four major TV series:  
**Friends**, **Game of Thrones**, **The Office**, and **The Big Bang Theory**.

Using natural language processing (NLP), we analyze patterns in scripts to uncover:
- Character similarities across shows
- Sentiment trends and emotional arcs
- Dialogue volume and use of language
- Script-based obscenity and tone

The goal is to identify whether perceived similarities between characters are supported by data, and how sentiment might correlate with broader show perception, including IMDB ratings.

## Framework Overview

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Raw Data** | Episode-level scripts sourced for all four shows |
| **Preprocessing** | Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, dialogue extraction |
| **NLP Analysis** | Sentiment scoring (VADER, TextBlob, Bing Liu), obscenity detection, and TF-IDF similarity |
| **Output** | Sentiment, Dialogues Similarity, Dialogues Distribution visualization |
